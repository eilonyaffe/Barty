Barty is a theoretical prototype that explores how large language models (LLMs) might be used to generate expressive opinions on political content. It scrapes recent political articles from [Breitbart](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/), filters them based on specified entities, and uses the Gemini 1.5 Flash model via DSPy to generate commentary.

## üîç Features

- **Web Scraping**: Gathers recent political articles from Breitbart.
- **Entity Filtering**: Keeps only articles mentioning keywords from `messages.json`.
- **Text Truncation**: Keeps article content within token limits for LLMs.
- **Opinion Generation**: Produces commentary in configurable tones (neutral, general, heated, or humoristic).
- **Stance Control**: Aligns opinions with a defined stance for each entity (`True = support`, `False = oppose`).
